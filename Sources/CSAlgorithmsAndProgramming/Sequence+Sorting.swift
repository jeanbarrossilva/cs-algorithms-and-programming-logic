  /// complexity will be O(*n*) if the collection is already sorted; otherwise,
  /// O(*n*²).
  ///
  /// Every element at index *i* in this collection will be compared to each of
  /// those by which it is succeeded, and swapped with such successor in case
  /// both the element at *i* and that at *i* + *j*, with *i* < *j* < *n*, where
  /// *j* is the distance between both in indices, are deemed unordered.
  ///
  /// - Complexity: O(*n*²).
  /// - Parameter areInOrder: Determines whether two elements of this
  ///   collection, one at index *i* and another at index *i* + *j*, are already
  ///   sorted. This closure returning `false` indicates to the algorithm that
  ///   both elements should be swaped.
