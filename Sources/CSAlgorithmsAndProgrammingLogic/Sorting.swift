  /// collection — and may be one of the most inefficient: given *n* elements,
  /// the time complexity will be, at best, O(*n*) if the collection is already
  /// sorted; otherwise, O(*n*²).
  ///
  /// An iteration is performed over each element of this collection; such
  /// element is, then, compared to the one adjacent to it, with both being
  /// swapped in case the first is greater than the second. Upon reaching the
  /// last pair, subsequent iterations from the start of the resulting
  /// collection will not be performed if no two elements were swapped in the
  /// last one; otherwise, this process repeats.
  ///
  /// This is similar to ``selectionSort(by:)``.
  ///
  /// - Complexity: O(*n*²).
